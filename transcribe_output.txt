I refuse to wear a mask and Chris I have to tell you something else I'm not vaccinated and I will be standing strong standing up for the people across this country that refused to get vaccinated eventually it caught up with her financially as the hell knows house rules makers $500 for their first infraction with the mask mandate and $2,500 for subsequent breaches the second one really hurts to be withdrawn from their yearly pay green wrapped up more than $100,000 in fines that's a lot of times refusing to wear masks that is also well over half of her annual salary everyone I'm Gabe Sanchez and welcome back to what was that Maggie Republicans have been facing some tough challenges lately and 180 in particular is a delusional Marjorie Taylor Greene she tried to get the Supreme Court to rates are $100,000 plus finds that she racked up for Define mask mandates during the pandemic and unfortunately for her the Court held that I get lost and pay up
 Marjorie Taylor Greene is a lot like a racist drunk after Uncle from Facebook the only difference is old Marg is in office and instead of hearing them yell about their crazy qanon conspiracy theories on Thanksgiving it's all year long and it's all over the news now if you weren't aware during the pandemic there was a simple rule in the house floor wear a face mask you know because there was a novel virus causing people to die or around the world sell the bare minimum that was being an ass was the distance and wear face masks now you think the show called pro-life Christians will be all about saving lives but like always with the GOP no, but it's a sacrifice I am willing to make the rule is simple if you don't wear masks on the house floor you be fined $500 in every subsequent offense would result in $2,500 each seems like a pretty straightforward rule with brown
 the more you're going to find out however apparently this is a very difficult concept to understand for Marjorie Taylor Greene and her Republican colleagues Singapore from speaker Pelosi that leads to fines if I continue to refuse to wear a mask well here's what I think of your warning speaker Pelosi
Marjorie Taylor Greene even took a selfie with Mary Millar Ralph Norman and Thomas Massie to protest against their so-called oppressors Marge tweeted a photo along with the caption hashtag free your face masks are oppressive and nothing but a political tool and the oppression what is the deal with white Republicans always trying to make themselves the victim's I'm a victim and I guess somehow wearing a thin piece of fabric for the small amount of time that you're on the house floor is torture is comparable to the Holocaust woman is mentally ill you know we can look back in a time in history where people were told to wear a gold star and they were definitely treated like second-class citizens citizens so much so that they were putting trains and taken to gas Chambers and Nazi Germany wow okay the worst take in modern history but what do you expect she is an anti-semitic idiot now Marjorie Taylor Greene Thomas Massie and Ralph Norman attempted to overturn their fine when they opted not to wear face masks on the house
 floor I also want you to know that before Marg and her friends try to appeal this in court they tried with the house Ethics Committee and will rejected so I'll Massey and Norman protested only briefly green continue to show for both without a mask for most of 2021 and into 2022 GE eventually accumulated more than $100,000 in fines which word doc from her $174,000 annual salary in March 2020 to a US District Judge in Washington throughout the lawmakers case the judge rejected the argument that the fines amounted to an illegal reduction in their annual salary and said Pelosi in her staff cannot be sued for decisions made in the government capacity the US court of appeals for the DC circuit upheld that ruling in June and that's when Marjorie Taylor Greene demanded to speak to the manager the manager being the Supreme Court now say what you will about her incompetent and billionaire loving Supreme Court but sometimes they get it right except more than $100,000 in fines that's a lot of times refusing to wear masks that is also well over half of her annual salary for the
 how much cement and two of her colleagues Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Ralph Norman of South Carolina brought a lawsuit of course they did against Den speaker Nancy Pelosi another house staffers they argued basically finds amounted to an illegal reduction of their salary they lost in front of the district court again as the US court of appeals and now the Supreme Court has refused the case altogether allowing a lower-court ruling to Stan so as it turns out the rules apply to you to Marjorie Taylor Greene mask up or pay-up I'm honestly surprised that Marjorie Taylor Greene was even able to count to a hundred thousand dollars when filing her appeal I mean we know how much he struggles with numbers what it did to our children's math and reading levels is horrific school closures brought them to the lowest levels in years England 8th graders math proficiency drop by seven points reading levels drop by to point me there are 1 million five hundred
 24500 + 24 + 481 this is over 1 million 1.5 million it does not have this much support he's going to come out and claimed that she's rising in the polls all these fake news media people up here on this platform or going to claim that Nikki Haley is rising in the polls it's a total complete lie absolutely like what do you expect Old Marge doesn't even know how to read this historical evidence is overwhelming that the founding fathers intended impeachment to be used to deal with the commission of indictable crimes in the abuse of power I'm not so sure that should be able to find a book you know one account of the GOP burning books like Valentina Gomez who's running for Missouri Secretary of State
 I text you but I'm kind of paying my library they will burn to burn it may be Republican to focus Less on Banning books and more and actually doing the job that they were elected to do but like always Republicans are unproductive biggest and they're useless while smiling and speaking of smiling I want to thank sponsor smileactives have you ever wish that you had a whiter and Brighter Smile while before you visit a dentist you should know that their whitening treatments can be very expensive and it's not just the price you also have to book the appointment and schedule time we from work or family to sit in a dentist's office chair while undergoing the procedure it's a hassle fortunately now you can try smile active at home or anywhere anytime smileactives offers a safe and affordable alternative to those expensive whitening procedures I've used other teeth whitening products in the past there were huge inconvenience for something that should be much easier and thanks to smile active it is easier 97% of smileactives users in a

 at waiting to the last minute watching the CR V I'm trying to throw us off on the numbers that we had versus the numbers they had so yeah that was a strategy at play tonight all we play like it is it's always about owning the lives regardless of the collateral damage but Marjorie Taylor Greene claim that Democrats had some secret strategy is idiotic its basic policy making someone proposed the bill and then everyone else votes on it it's not rocket science now she may not be a rocket scientist but Marjorie Taylor Greene does claimed that she has a PHD in recognizing DS thank you mr. chairman I'm not a doctor but I have a PhD in recognizing bullshit when I hear it very glad you're not we also knew that children were at no rest practically zero risk of being hospitalized or deaths from covid-19 in just for contact Marjorie Taylor Greene is responding to an expert witness who testified that the covid-19 vaccine in booster save millions of lives you know
 in case you needed another reason to dislike this horrible anti-life Republican it's time to be honest about the vaccine injured and we need to stop allowing these covid-19 vaccine to be given seriously the fact that she sits on a committee is nuts which I guess makes sense when you remember that she's clinically insane figures in Sherman I'm sorry y'all had to go through that that was a lot of conspiracy theories and wild accusations I wish we now have been debunked by by Medical Science and we should be clear that vaccines work and save lives and they have millions of lives in this country countless post has spread misinformation encouraged parents to refuse routine vaccinations for their children which you just heard by the way and even compared our pandemic efforts responses to the Holocaust I want to just actually read something which is in the public record I'm not saying anything that's not in the public record
 remember this committee actually said the same person that is actually attacking vaccines said that vaccinated employees getting vaccinated logo the vaccination logo just like the Nazis force Jewish people to wear a gold star I want to I want to read that again vaccinated employees getting vaccinations logo just like the Nazis forced Jewish people to wear a gold star
 that is the level of insanity in attacks that we're having here as we actually debate this lives saved around vaccinations now this same members also held Shadow public hearings promoting ideas at covid is a bio-weapon to Target people of specific races and their vaccines and I quote cause trouble cancers I want I want to read you this this quote and it's in the public record at a hearing
 have the covid vaccine resulted in an increase in Cancers and our turbo cancer is real this is my opinion just Insanity we know that's not the case dr. Mark so you clarify once again for the American people do the code vaccines cause turbo cancers I'm a hematologist-oncologist adjust its board certified I don't know what a turbo cancer is a show this late because we need to continue to do what represent of Garcia's doing in this Committee hearing calling out the idiocy of Republican politician we need to mock them at every single turn I mean that's why I keep making the show unfortunately the pro-life party won't lift a finger to save the children people like Marjorie Taylor Greene won't even get the vaccine themselves people like me I'm not vaccinated I refuse to wear a mask and Chris I have to tell you something else I'm not vaccinated I'm not vaccinated vaccine also it was in that same Whitfield County Office where Marjorie Taylor Greene
 running a cardboard cutout of trump praise him and then began rubbing her hand on his crotch definitely not a cult though but seriously this woman is an embarrassment or democracy in needs to be removed from office ASAP because I left alone she might do some real harm but thankfully she's kind of busy losing court cases and getting drunk on camera at Trump's party's over with imagine being a donor Enlighten your money on fire like that donating the Nikki Haley begging her to stay in the race I mean these political Consultants they should go to jail and feel free to follow me I am Gabe Sanchez and remember this show is made possible by contributions from viewers like you do if you'd like to support this one-man show and keep the lights on please consider subscribing to my patreon at patreon.com I am Gabe Sanchez thank you for your support Bill until next episode on Gabe Sanchez and this has been what was that
